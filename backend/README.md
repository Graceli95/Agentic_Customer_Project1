## Multi-Agent Architecture (Phase 4)

### Overview

Phase 4 implements a comprehensive **multi-agent supervisor pattern** with 4 specialized worker agents. The supervisor intelligently analyzes incoming queries and routes them to the most appropriate domain expert, enabling specialized responses across technical support, billing, compliance, and general information domains.

**Architecture Diagram:**
```
User Query → FastAPI /chat Endpoint
    ↓
Supervisor Agent (Analyzes Query & Routes)
    ↓
    ├─→ [Technical Support Tool] → Technical Worker → Response (errors, bugs, crashes)
    ├─→ [Billing Support Tool] → Billing Worker → Response (payments, invoices, refunds)
    ├─→ [Compliance Tool] → Compliance Worker → Response (policies, privacy, GDPR/CCPA)
    ├─→ [General Info Tool] → General Info Worker → Response (company info, services)
    └─→ [Direct Handling] → Response (greetings, thanks, simple queries)
         ↓
    User receives specialized response
```

### How It Works

1. **User sends query** to `/chat` endpoint with session_id
2. **Supervisor agent analyzes** the query to understand intent and domain
3. **Routing decision** to appropriate specialist:
   - **Technical queries** (errors, bugs, crashes, troubleshooting) → Technical Support worker
   - **Billing queries** (payments, invoices, subscriptions, refunds) → Billing Support worker
   - **Compliance queries** (policies, privacy, GDPR/CCPA, data deletion) → Compliance worker
   - **General queries** (company info, services, features, FAQs) → General Information worker
   - **Simple queries** (greetings, thanks, clarifications) → Handles directly
4. **Response generation**:
   - Worker agents provide specialized domain expertise
   - Supervisor ensures complete, accurate response returned to user
5. **Memory maintained** across routing via checkpointer + thread_id

### Supervisor Agent

**Location:** `backend/agents/supervisor_agent.py`

    """
```

**Key Features:**

### Routing Logic

The supervisor uses **tool descriptions** to intelligently route queries to the most appropriate worker:

**Routes to Technical Support Tool when query contains:**
- Error messages (e.g., "Error 500", "404 not found")
- Problem keywords (e.g., "not working", "broken", "fails", "crash")
- Technical terms (e.g., "install", "configure", "setup", "performance")
- Troubleshooting requests (e.g., "how do I fix", "can't access")

**Routes to Billing Support Tool when query contains:**
- Payment keywords (e.g., "payment", "charge", "charged", "invoice")
- Subscription terms (e.g., "subscription", "upgrade", "downgrade", "cancel")
- Refund requests (e.g., "refund", "money back", "charged twice")
- Pricing inquiries (e.g., "how much", "cost", "price", "plan")

**Routes to Compliance Tool when query contains:**
- Policy keywords (e.g., "privacy policy", "terms of service", "policies")
- Regulatory terms (e.g., "GDPR", "CCPA", "data protection", "compliance")
- Data rights (e.g., "delete my data", "export data", "data access")
- Legal questions (e.g., "legal", "regulations", "rights", "consent")

**Routes to General Info Tool when query contains:**
- Company inquiries (e.g., "about your company", "who are you", "what do you do")
- Service questions (e.g., "what services", "features", "offerings")
- Getting started (e.g., "how do I start", "getting started", "onboarding")
- Plan comparisons (e.g., "compare plans", "which plan", "differences")

**Handles directly when query is:**
- Greetings (e.g., "Hello", "Hi there")
- Gratitude (e.g., "Thank you", "Thanks")
- Clarifications (e.g., "What do you mean?", "Can you explain?")
- Simple acknowledgments (e.g., "That makes sense", "I understand")

**Routing Visibility:**

The system logs routing decisions for debugging:

```bash
# Technical query routed to worker
🔀 ROUTING: Query routed to worker agent (session: abc-123, time: 1.5s)

# General query handled directly
✋ DIRECT: Supervisor handled query directly (session: abc-123, time: 0.3s)
```

### Adding New Worker Agents

Follow this pattern to add new specialized workers:

**1. Create Worker Module** (`agents/workers/your_worker.py`):

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.tools import tool
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def create_your_worker_agent():
    """Create specialized worker agent."""
    system_prompt = """You are a specialist in [domain].
    Your role is to...
    
    CRITICAL: The supervisor only sees your final message.
    Include ALL results, findings, and details in your final response.
    """
    
    agent = create_agent(
        model="openai:gpt-4o-mini",
        tools=[],  # Worker-specific tools if needed
        system_prompt=system_prompt,
        name="your_worker_agent",  # Descriptive name
    )
    
    logger.info(f"Your worker agent created successfully")
    return agent

# Module-level singleton
_agent_instance = None

def get_your_worker():
    """Get singleton instance of worker agent."""
    global _agent_instance
    if _agent_instance is None:
        _agent_instance = create_your_worker_agent()
    return _agent_instance

# Tool wrapper for supervisor
@tool
def your_worker_tool(query: str) -> str:
    """Handle [domain] questions.
    
    Use this tool when users ask about [specific topics].
    Examples: [list examples]
    """
    logger.info(f"Your worker tool called with query: {query[:50]}...")
    
    agent = get_your_worker()
    result = agent.invoke({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": query}]})
    response = result["messages"][-1].content
    
    logger.info(f"Your worker tool returning response: {response[:50]}...")
    return response
```

**2. Export from Workers Package** (`agents/workers/__init__.py`):

```python
from agents.workers.your_worker import (
    create_your_worker_agent,
    get_your_worker,
    your_worker_tool,  # Primary export for supervisor
)

__all__ = [
    # ... existing exports ...
    "create_your_worker_agent",
    "get_your_worker", 
    "your_worker_tool",
]
```

**3. Register with Supervisor** (`agents/supervisor_agent.py`):

```python
from agents.workers import technical_support_tool, your_worker_tool

# In create_supervisor_agent():
tools = [
    technical_support_tool,
    your_worker_tool,  # Add your tool
]

system_prompt = """...
3. Route [domain] questions to the Your Worker specialist
...
"""
```

**4. Write Tests** (`tests/test_your_worker.py`):

```python
import pytest
from agents.workers.your_worker import (
    create_your_worker_agent,
    get_your_worker,
    your_worker_tool,
)

@pytest.mark.unit
def test_create_your_worker_agent():
    """Test your worker agent creation."""
    agent = create_your_worker_agent()
    assert agent is not None
    # ... more assertions ...
```

**5. Update Supervisor System Prompt** with routing guidelines for new worker.

### Best Practices for Multi-Agent Systems

**DO:**
- ✅ Give each worker a clear, non-overlapping domain
- ✅ Write specific tool descriptions to guide supervisor routing
- ✅ Emphasize final output in worker system prompts
- ✅ Test workers independently before integration
- ✅ Use `ToolRuntime` to pass conversation context if needed
- ✅ Monitor routing decisions with logging

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Overlap worker responsibilities (causes routing confusion)
- ❌ Forget to remind workers that supervisor only sees final output
- ❌ Skip testing individual workers (test before integration)
- ❌ Use manual LangGraph for basic multi-agent (use supervisor pattern)

```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode (with auto-reload)

```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Run with uvicorn
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Or run the main.py directly:**

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will be available at:
- **API**: http://localhost:8000
- **Interactive Docs (Swagger)**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Alternative Docs (ReDoc)**: http://localhost:8000/redoc
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

### Production Mode

```bash
# Run without auto-reload
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
```

**Recommended Production Settings:**
- Use multiple workers (`--workers 4` for a 4-core CPU)
- Set `LOG_LEVEL=INFO` or `LOG_LEVEL=WARNING`
- Use a process manager like **Supervisor** or **systemd**
- Deploy behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, etc.)

## Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate

# Run all tests with coverage
pytest

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_main.py -v
```

### Run Tests with Coverage Report

```bash
# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# View HTML coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html  # macOS
# xdg-open htmlcov/index.html  # Linux
# start htmlcov/index.html  # Windows
```

### Test Categories

Tests are organized with markers:
- `@pytest.mark.unit` - Fast, isolated unit tests (44 tests)
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Integration tests (10 tests, requires --run-integration flag)
- `@pytest.mark.slow` - Slow-running tests

```bash
# Run only unit tests (fast, no API calls)
pytest -m unit

# Run integration tests (with mocked supervisor)
pytest -m integration --run-integration

# Run all tests including integration
pytest --run-integration

# Skip slow tests
pytest -m "not slow"
```

**Phase 3 Test Suite:**
- **test_supervisor.py** - 15 unit tests for supervisor agent
- **test_technical_worker.py** - 19 unit tests for technical worker
- **test_main.py** - 37 total tests (27 endpoint + 10 integration routing tests)
- **Total**: 54 tests, all passing ✅

### Testing Multi-Agent Routing

**Manual Test Script:**

Use the provided script to test routing decisions with real API calls:

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x test_routing_logs.sh

# Run the test script (requires backend server running)
./test_routing_logs.sh
```

The script sends both technical and general queries, showing routing decisions in logs:
- Technical queries show `🔀 ROUTING` indicator (routed to worker)
- General queries show `✋ DIRECT` indicator (handled by supervisor)

**Example Manual Test (with curl):**

```bash
# Start backend server in one terminal
uvicorn main:app --reload

# In another terminal, test technical query (should route)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Getting Error 500 when trying to log in",
    "session_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  }'

# Check logs - should see: 🔀 ROUTING: Query routed to worker agent

# Test general query (should handle directly)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Hello! How are you?",
    "session_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  }'

# Check logs - should see: ✋ DIRECT: Supervisor handled query directly
```

**Example Usage (curl):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "What services do you offer?",
    "session_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  }'
```

**Example Usage (Python):**
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/chat",
    json={
        "message": "Hello, how are you?",
        "session_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
    }
)

data = response.json()
print(f"AI: {data['response']}")
```

**Conversation Memory & Routing:**
The supervisor maintains conversation history for each session_id, even across routing to different workers. Use the same session_id for follow-up messages to maintain context.

**Example - Technical Query with Routing:**

```python
# Technical query - routed to Technical Support worker
response1 = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/chat", json={
    "message": "Getting Error 500 when logging in",
    "session_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
})
# Response from Technical Support worker with troubleshooting steps
# Log shows: 🔀 ROUTING: Query routed to worker agent

# Follow-up - context maintained across routing
response2 = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/chat", json={
    "message": "I tried that but still not working",
    "session_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"  # Same session
})
# Worker remembers previous steps and provides next troubleshooting options
```

**Example - General Query (Direct Handling):**
```python
# General greeting - handled directly by supervisor
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/chat", json={
    "message": "Hello! How are you?",
    "session_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-4789-a012-3456789abcde"
})
# Response from supervisor directly (no routing needed)
# Log shows: ✋ DIRECT: Supervisor handled query directly
```

#### Interactive Documentation
- **Swagger UI**: `/docs` - Test endpoints interactively
- **ReDoc**: `/redoc` - Clean, searchable API reference
- **OpenAPI Schema**: `/openapi.json` - Machine-readable API spec

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

This project uses **Ruff** for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check code quality
ruff check .

# Auto-fix issues
ruff check . --fix

# Format code
ruff format .
```

### Adding New Endpoints

1. Add endpoint function in `main.py` or create a new router
2. Use type hints and Pydantic models for request/response
3. Add docstrings explaining the endpoint
4. Write tests in `tests/` directory
5. Update API documentation

**Example:**
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

class QueryRequest(BaseModel):
    message: str

class QueryResponse(BaseModel):
    response: str

router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v1")

@router.post("/query", response_model=QueryResponse)
async def handle_query(request: QueryRequest):
    """Handle customer service query."""
    # Your logic here
    return QueryResponse(response="...")
```

### Adding New Worker Agents (Phase 3+)

See the detailed "Adding New Worker Agents" section in the Multi-Agent Architecture documentation above for a complete guide. Summary:

1. Create worker module in `agents/workers/your_worker.py`
2. Use `create_agent()` with specialized system prompt
3. Create `@tool` wrapper function for supervisor integration
4. Export from `agents/workers/__init__.py`
5. Register tool with supervisor in `supervisor_agent.py`
6. Update supervisor system prompt with routing guidelines
7. Write comprehensive unit tests (`tests/test_your_worker.py`)
8. Test independently before integration

**Key Pattern:**
- Worker agents provide specialized expertise
- Tool wrappers enable supervisor integration
- Clear tool descriptions guide routing decisions
- Workers return complete responses (supervisor only sees final message)

### LangChain v1.0 Best Practices

- ✅ Use `create_agent()` for agent creation
- ✅ Use `@tool` decorator for tool definitions
- ✅ Use checkpointers for conversation memory
- ✅ Enable LangSmith tracing for debugging
- ❌ Avoid deprecated LCEL patterns
- ❌ Don't use `create_react_agent()` (removed in v1.0)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Import Errors
```bash
# Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain'
# Solution: Make sure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Error: OSError: [Errno 48] Address already in use
# Solution: Change port or kill existing process
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```

#### OpenAI API Key Not Found
```bash
# Error: openai.error.AuthenticationError
# Solution: Set OPENAI_API_KEY in .env file
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env
```

#### ChromaDB Permission Errors
```bash
# Error: PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'chroma_db'
# Solution: Create directory with proper permissions
mkdir -p chroma_db
chmod 755 chroma_db
```

#### SSL Certificate Errors (macOS)
```bash
# Error: SSLCertVerificationError
# Solution: Install Python certificates
/Applications/Python\ 3.*/Install\ Certificates.command
```

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```bash
# Set in .env file
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Or run with debug flag
uvicorn main:app --reload --log-level debug
```

### LangSmith Tracing (Highly Recommended)

LangSmith provides detailed traces of agent execution, showing:
- Every LLM call made by the agent
- Input/output of each step
- Token usage and costs
- Latency for each operation
- Error details with full stack traces

**Setup:**

1. Create account at https://smith.langchain.com/
2. Get API key from Settings
3. Add to `.env` file:

```bash
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_your_actual_key_here
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=customer-service-phase2
```

4. Restart backend server
5. Make API calls to `/chat`
6. View traces at: https://smith.langchain.com/

**Example Trace Information:**
```
📊 Trace: POST /chat
├── Agent Invocation
│   ├── Model: gpt-4o-mini
│   ├── Input: "Hello, how are you?"
│   ├── Output: "Hello! I'm doing well..."
│   ├── Tokens: 45 (15 input, 30 output)
│   └── Latency: 1.2s
└── Checkpointer: InMemorySaver
    └── Session: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Debug agent behavior step-by-step
- ✅ Monitor token usage and costs
- ✅ Identify performance bottlenecks
- ✅ Analyze error patterns
- ✅ Compare different prompts/models

**No code changes needed** - just environment variables!
